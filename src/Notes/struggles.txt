NAV BAR

    The main struggle i spend my time on was in the dropdown menu for contacts near the profile icon at top right
                It was tricky because i was trying ti kee it open even when i move cursor to it. The problem was that there was a gap so the cursor was going out of bounds. I kept trying to fix it without understanding that was the problem.

    And the transition when i scroll is tough to fix

    I wanna add some responsivity later, maybe make buttons sizes as percentages with a max size and also the same with max-height of the whole nav container
